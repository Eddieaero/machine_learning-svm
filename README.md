# Support Vector Machine for Classification

## Overview

Your task is to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. You will make use of a library routine to solve the optimization problem which emerges in the dual formulation of the support vector machine. You need to write code for structuring the data so that the library routine can find the maximal-margin solution, and code for transforming this solution into a classifier which can process new data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```sh
# pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
